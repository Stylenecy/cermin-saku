# Contributions

This repository starts from **Cermin** by Yeheskiel Yunus Tame, MIT
([original](https://github.com/yeheskieltame/Cermin), Mezo Hackathon 2, May 2026; BNB Chain port by its author, late September 2026).
Commit [`e767fde`](https://github.com/Stylenecy/cermin-saku/commit/e767fde) is the original published code, unchanged
(source: `bcc-ukdw/seed-bnb` at `52671ce`, folder `Cermin/`; the Mezo pitch deck, Mezo logo files, a blog copy and
three Mezo-era screenshots were left out of the import).

Everything below was built by **Dex Bennett** on 5–7 October 2026, within the Indonesia Web3 Hackathon 2026 submission period.
To see exactly what changed in the original files: `git diff e767fde -- contracts/src agent/src frontend/src`.

## What is new

| Area | New | Changed from Cermin |
|---|---|---|
| Contracts | `CerminSaku.sol` (schedules, permissionless `release`, holds), `CerminLens.sol` (price lines, previews) | `CerminVault.sol` v1.1: spend allowance for a delegated spender, the two Saku safety gates (`_sakuStatus`), Saku policy, min debt / gas compensation as deploy-time immutables. `ICerminVault.sol` extended. Mocks: admin functions made owner-only; gas compensation configurable. `Deploy.s.sol` rewritten for the full stack + JSON manifest |
| Tests | `test/saku/`: 28 Saku unit + fuzz, 2 crash-reserve stress tests (`SakuStress.t.sol`), 7 Lens (preview equals execution, exact pause-price boundary), 8 in the invariant suite: 7 invariants (paid ≤ granted, allowance accounting, no unsafe payment, ledger = balances, BNB never decreases, spendable backed, periods bounded) + 1 positive control | The original 33 tests kept; only `setUp` adapted to the new constructors (logic untouched) |
| Keeper | `monitors/saku.ts`, `executors/release.ts`, `scripts/demo.ts`, `abis/generated.ts`, 6 node:test cases | `index.ts` runs Saku after skim/defend; `config.ts` (SAKU_ADDRESS, hold cooldown, chain 31337); `chain.ts` (Anvil) |
| Web | `/demo` (no-wallet demo vault), `/saku` (schedule envelopes), `/terima` (recipient view), Lens panel, on-chain passbook, Google / email sign-in (Privy, wallet created on login), ID/EN switch, Rupiah display with a labelled indicative rate, landing copy and sections rewritten for Cermin Saku (calculator, gate visual), wallet balance checks in onboarding | Cermin's own design system kept (Fraunces + Geist, paper, components, watercolour illustrations) and recoloured to blue, green and brown (`scripts/recolor-art.py`); Cermin's dashboard and onboarding translated and extended |
| Ops | GitHub Actions CI, local Anvil rehearsal, fork rehearsal, one-command deploy + wiring (`scripts/`), BSC testnet deployment from Dex's own fresh deployer, on-chain demo run (`docs/TESTNET-DEPLOY.md`), passbook export (`agent/scripts/ledger.ts`) | The original port notes moved to `docs/upstream-*` |
